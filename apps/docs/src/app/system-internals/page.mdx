# System Internals

This guide will look at the internals of Model Gateway. We'll cover the database schema and technologies used. {{ className: 'lead' }}

## Database schema

Model Gateway uses a PostgreSQL database to store its data. The database schema is managed by Prisma, which is an ORM that provides a type-safe way to interact with the database. The schema is defined in the `schema.prisma` file in the Model Gateway repository.

The primary entities are:
- **Inference Enpoint** - Represents an endpoint where you can send AI inference requests.
- **Gateway** - Represents a gateway that your apps connect to. Gateway validates your request and forward it to specified inference endpoint. Gateways can have multiple inference endpoints.
- **Gateway Key** - Represents an API key that you use to authenticate your requests to the gateway.

Here is a simplified high-level database schema:

## Technologies used

Model Gateway is built using the following technologies:
- **PostgreSQL** - Database to store data.
- **Prisma** - ORM for database access.
- **TypeScript** - Programming language.
- **GraphQL** - Query language for management APIs.
- **Next.js** - React framework for the admin interface.
- **Tailwind CSS** - CSS framework.
- **Express** - Web framework for the gateway server.
- **Docker** - Containerization platform.
