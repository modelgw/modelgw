# Audit Tracing

Model Gateway can provide audit tracing of all requests and responses to your inference endpoints. Tracing can be enabled on desired gateways. {{ className: 'lead' }}

Enabling **trace traffic** will save all requests and responses to the database. By default, only the metadata is saved. You can enable **trace payload** to save the full request and response payloads.

If you want to log all requests and responses, you can enable **log traffic**. This will log all requests and responses without the payload using the default logger. You can also enable **log payload** to log the full request and response payloads.

## Enabling tracing and logging

Tracing can be enabled via API by setting `traceTraffic` and `tracePayload` to `true` on `Gateway`. Logging can be enabled via API by setting `logTraffic` and `logPayload` to `true` on `Gateway`.

These settings can be changed also via *Admin Console* on the desired gateway.

## Viewing traces

Traces can be viewed via *Admin Console* at http://localhost:3000/traces. You can filter traces by a gateway, and time range. You can also view the full request and response payloads if they are enabled. Traces viewer can visualize the request and response payloads in a human-readable format and has support for streamed responses.

## Exporting traces

Traces can be exported via API by calling `gatewayRequests` query or directly from the database tables.
