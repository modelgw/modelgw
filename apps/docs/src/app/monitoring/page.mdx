# Monitoring

Model Gateway provides a monitoring endpoint that can be used to monitor the health of your Model Gateway. All actions performed by the Model Gateway are logged and can be viewed in the logs. {{ className: 'lead' }}

## Health Check

The monitoring endpoint is available at `/health` on Management endpoint. You can send a GET request to the monitoring endpoint to check the health of your Model Gateway. It returns HTTP status code `200` if everything is working, `503` otherwise. Response body contains JSON with detail information.
